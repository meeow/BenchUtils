# BenchUtils
Computer benchmarking and stress testing tools.    
Currently parses rivatuner (msi afterburner) logfiles and performs basic statistical calculations.   
Project put on hold since major benchmarks require an expensive license to use CLI, may focus on data vis rather than benchmarking automation in the future.
